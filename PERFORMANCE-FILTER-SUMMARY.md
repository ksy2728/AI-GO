# Performance Filtering Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

As requested, I've implemented an intelligent performance filtering system that excludes below-average AI models during the sync process from Artificial Analysis. This prevents low-performing models from cluttering the interface.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Average Calculation
- Automatically calculates the average intelligence score from all fetched models
- Filters out models below this average
- Adapts as new models are added to AA

### 2. Flexible Configuration
- **AA_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_FILTER**: Enable/disable filtering (default: true)
- **AA_MIN_INTELLIGENCE**: Optional custom threshold (when not set, uses average)

### 3. Current Results
From the latest test run:
- Fetched: 17 models total
- Average Intelligence: 43.12
- Kept: 9 models (above average)
- Filtered: 8 models (below average)

## Files Modified/Created

1. **src/services/sync-aa-real-data.ts**
   - Added `calculateAverageIntelligence()` function
   - Added `filterModelsByPerformance()` function
   - Integrated filtering into main sync workflow

2. **.env.local**
   - Commented out fixed `AA_MIN_INTELLIGENCE=60`
   - Added `AA_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_FILTER=true`

3. **New Test Files**
   - `test-performance-filter.js` - Analyzes filtering impact
   - `run-sync-with-filter.js` - Convenience script for filtered sync
   - `docs/PERFORMANCE-FILTERING.md` - Documentation

## How It Works

1. Fetches all models from AA (API + intelligence-index.json)
2. Calculates average intelligence score (currently ~43)
3. Filters out models below average
4. Only syncs high-quality models to database

## Configuration Examples

### Use Dynamic Average (Default)
```bash
# In .env.local
AA_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_FILTER=true
# AA_MIN_INTELLIGENCE=  # Commented out
```

### Use Fixed Threshold
```bash
# In .env.local
AA_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_FILTER=true
AA_MIN_INTELLIGENCE=40
```

### Disable Filtering
```bash
# In .env.local
AA_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_FILTER=false
```

## Benefits

1. **Quality Focus**: Only high-performance models shown to users
2. **Cleaner Interface**: Reduces clutter from low-quality models
3. **Better UX**: Easier model selection and comparison
4. **Flexible**: Easy to adjust via environment variables
5. **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts as AA adds new models

## Next Steps

The performance filtering is now active and working. To deploy:

1. Ensure `.env.local` settings are correct
2. Run sync: `npx tsx src/services/sync-aa-real-data.ts`
3. Deploy to production

The system will automatically filter out below-average models, keeping only the high-quality ones for users to see.
